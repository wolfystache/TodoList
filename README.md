# TodoList

This repository contains two folders, TodoListBasic and TodoListExtra. The basic folder contains the basic implementation of the Todo List detailed in the assignment page. The second folder, 
TodoListExtra contains the 'stretch goal' implementation. Since they have divergent user experiences I decided to include them both in the repository. 

Both contain identical filenames and folders: index.html is the layout for the assignment, and Scripts/todoList.js contains the scripting.
